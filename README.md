# WebDesignProject

-Web Design Project (2nd semester of "Analyst in Programming / IT" career in ORT).
-CSS & HTML only. (No JS / other languages, so the buttons & form won't work).
-The page is meant to be viewed with at least 1200px resolution. (Responsiveness & adaptability were not requested/evaluated/permitted for this project).
-Download the .zip and double click the .html for a quick view of the end project.
